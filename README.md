## Current activity: implementing tracedef simulations with more than 1 compactified dimensions
### Todo:
- [ ] Check that results for tracedef\_dim=1 are unchanged from original code
- [ ] Check code for tracedef\_dim=2
- [ ] (Eventually) Figure out a way to index tracedef parameters h[i,j]
- [ ] (Eventually) Generalize code to arbitrary tracedef\_dim, as this hack is kinda ugly
