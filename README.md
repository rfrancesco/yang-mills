# Fork of claudio-bonati/yang-mills
## Current project: Extending yang\_mills\_tracedef to 2 (or higher) compactified dimensions
### TODO:
- [x] upd\_with\_tracedef(): extend to higher dimensions in a consistent way
- [x] metropolis\_with\_tracedef(): extend to 2 dimensions, including mixed terms Tr (P1 P2)... (note: just for NCOLOR=3)
